  #----- beginning of test for offline prod - local run only ------------------
  # DO NOT REMOVE this scenario
  # This scenario is not part of the regular regression run BUT is for aiding the team to do offline prod testing if needed
  # note: this setup is for the case when we need to validate on offline prod environment
  # note: this is intended for local run where you can put in your own member auth username/password and offline username
  # note: run with environment variable set to offline. -Denvironment="offline"
  # note: *** DO NOT save your login or test username to github ***
  # note: replace the following fields with valid value -
  # note:   username = your memAuth page login username
  # note:   password = your memAuth page login password
  # note:   MemUsername =  username of the user on offline prod that you want to test
  # note:   planType = the type of plan this test user has e.g. MAPD/MA/SHIP, etc
  # note:   memberType = e.g. Individual / GROUP/ COMBO, etc
