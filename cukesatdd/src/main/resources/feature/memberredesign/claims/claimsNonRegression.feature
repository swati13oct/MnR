Feature: T1.1To validate the claims Summary page and claims Details page on the member site

  #----- beginning of claims00 ---------------------------------------------------------
  # DO NOT REMOVE this scenario
  # This scenario is not part of the regular regression run 
  # BUT is a daily run being monitored by the team

  Scenario Outline: DID: <DID> -plan: <planType> -memberType: <memberType> -claimSystem: <claimSystem> -claimType: <claimType> -Segment ID: <segmentId> - <index> - Perform detail validation for claims on both summary and detail page for each search range options
    Given login with following details logins in the member portal and validate elements
      | Plan Type    | <planType>    |
      | Member Type  | <memberType>  |
      | Claim System | <claimSystem> |
    When if I access via dashboard I can navigate to claims summary page from View Your Claims
    When I navigate to the claims Summary page from dashboard or testharness page
    Then I can validate the claims summary header on claims summary page
      | Plan Type   | <planType>   |
      | Member Type | <memberType> |
    Then I can validate the segment ID value in localStorage on claims summary page
      | Segment ID   | <segmentId>   |
    #----------------- Test Custom calendar and search error cases --------------------------
    ## note: covered in E2E, keep in case want to test here also
    ##And I can search claims for claim period and claim type on claim summary page
    ##  | Plan Type    | <planType>    |
    ##  | Member Type  | <memberType>  |
    ##  | Claim Type   | <claimType>   |
    ##  | Claim System | <claimSystem> |
    ##  | Claim Period | Custom search |
	##Then I can validate the calendar will show up for custom search when click on From and To calendars    
    ##And I should be able to see the error message when no to and from dates being entered
    ##And I custom search claims for the following invalid time interval on claims summary page
    ##  | Claims From Date | 01/02/2019 |
    ##  | Claims To Date   | 01/02/2018 |
    ##Then I should be able to see the from date is greater than the to date error message being displayed
    ##And I custom search claims for over two years time interval from current date on claims summary page
    ##Then I should be able to see the search range is greater than two years error
    #----------------- Test for Custom search --------------------------
    And I can search claims for claim period and claim type on claim summary page
      | Plan Type    | <planType>    |
      | Member Type  | <memberType>  |
      | Claim Type   | <claimType>   |
      | Claim System | <claimSystem> |
      | Claim Period | Custom search |
    And I custom search claims for the specific time interval on claims summary page
    Then I can see the number of claims
    Then I perform extensive validation for values between claims summary and claim details page
    #----------------- Test for- Last 30 days --------------------------
    And I can search claims for claim period and claim type on claim summary page
      | Plan Type    | <planType>    |
      | Member Type  | <memberType>  |
      | Claim Type   | <claimType>   |
      | Claim System | <claimSystem> |
      | Claim Period | Last 30 days  |
    Then I can see the number of claims
    Then I perform extensive validation for values between claims summary and claim details page
    #----------------- Test for Last 90 days --------------------------
    And I can search claims for claim period and claim type on claim summary page
      | Plan Type    | <planType>    |

      | Claim Type   | <claimType>   |
      | Claim System | <claimSystem> |
      | Claim Period | Last 90 days  |
    Then I can see the number of claims
    Then I perform extensive validation for values between claims summary and claim details page
    #----------------- Test for Last 6 months --------------------------
    And I can search claims for claim period and claim type on claim summary page
      | Plan Type    | <planType>    |

      | Claim Type   | <claimType>   |
      | Claim System | <claimSystem> |
      | Claim Period | Last 6 months |
    Then I can see the number of claims
    Then I perform extensive validation for values between claims summary and claim details page
    #----------------- Test for Last 12 months --------------------------
    And I can search claims for claim period and claim type on claim summary page
      | Plan Type    | <planType>     |

    Then I can see the number of claims
    #note: covered by E2E also - skip on jenkins run to keep run time within 30 min
    ##And I validate the pagination on the claims summary page for given range
    ##Then I can validate the learn more and print and download option and DownloadMyData section on claims summary page

  # note:   password = your memAuth page login password
  # note:   MemUsername =  username of the user on offline prod that you want to test
  # note:   planType = the type of plan this test user has e.g. MAPD/MA/SHIP, etc
  # note:   memberType = e.g. Individual / GROUP/ COMBO, etc

  Scenario Outline: To validate via member authorization access for claims
    Given the user is on member auth login flow page
    When the member is able to login with correct username and password
      | Username | <username> |
      | Password | <password> |
    And Member Enters the Username he wants to search
      | MemUsername | <MemUserName> |
    And user clicks on member to select
    When I navigate to the claims Summary page from dashboard or testharness page
    Then I can validate the claims summary header on claims summary page
      | Plan Type   | <planType>   |
      | Member Type | <memberType> |
    Then I can validate the segment ID value in localStorage on claims summary page
      | Segment ID   | <segmentId>   |
    #----------------- Test for Last 24 months --------------------------
    And I can search claims for claim period and claim type on claim summary page
      | Plan Type    | <planType>     |
      | Member Type  | <memberType>   |
      | Claim Type   | <claimType>    |
      | Claim System | <claimSystem>  |
      | Claim Period | Last 24 months |
    Then I can see the number of claims
    And I validate the pagination on the claims summary page for given range
    Then I can validate the learn more and print and download option and DownloadMyData section on claims summary page
    Then I can validate claims table displayed based on the selection on claims summary page
    And I can validate the EOB section based on claims system on claims summary page
    And I validate the Need Help section content on claims summary page
    #----------
    # note: These two steps below only applicable to SHIP and MEDICAL claims, NOTHING will be done for DRUG case
    Then I validate Claim Details page content value and Learn More and EOB and tooltips
    Then I perform extensive validation for values between claims summary and claim details page
    #----------

    Examples: 
      | index | TID | username   | password   | MemUserName  | planType | memberType | claimSystem    | claimType | segmentId | flagZeroClaimsUser |
      |    01 | 000 | myUsername | myPassword | testUsername | SHIP     | COMBO      | COMPASS_CLAIMS | NA        | 000       | Yes                |
