Feature: T1.1To validate the claims Summary page and claims Details page on the member site - Extensive

  #----- beginning of claims00 ---------------------------------------------------------
  # DO NOT REMOVE this scenario
  # This scenario is not part of the regular regression run 
  # BUT is a daily run being monitored by the team
  # note: bypassIssue-1 - YourShare value mismatch between summary and detail - INC10332773
  # note: bypassIssue-2 - MA NICE missing Search EOB History on both summary and detail page - INC11365785
  # note: bypassIssue-2 - MAPD NICE missing Search EOB History on detail page - INC11365785

  # note: C=COSMOS, N=NICE, R=Rx, S=Ship, M=Medical, D=Drug 
  # note: Each of these tags has a jenkins job of its own.  
  # note: Each tag should consists of about limited amount of examples to keep jenkins job run time reasonable
  # note:   For COSMOS and Medical  - @claims00_C_M_p1 | @claims00_C_M_p2 
  # note:   For COSMOS and Drug     - @claims00_C_D_p1

  Scenario Outline: -userSelection: <userSelection> -TID: <TID> -planType: <planType> -memberType: <memberType> -claimSystem: <claimSystem> -claimType: <claimType> -Segment ID: <segmentId> - Perform detail validation for claims on both summary and detail page for each search range options
    Given login with following details logins in the member portal and validate elements for microapp
      | Plan Type      | <planType>      |
      | Member Type    | <memberType>    |
      | Claim System   | <claimSystem>   |
      | User Selection | <userSelection> |
    #When if I access via dashboard I can navigate to claims summary page from View Your Claims
    When I navigate to the claims Summary page from dashboard or testharness page
    Then I can validate the claims summary header on claims summary page
      | Plan Type   | <planType>   |
      | Member Type | <memberType> |
    Then I can validate the segment ID value in localStorage on claims summary page
      | Segment ID   | <segmentId>   |
    #----------------- Test Custom calendar and search error cases --------------------------
    ## note: covered in E2E, keep in case want to test here also
    ##And I can search claims for claim period and claim type on claim summary page
    ##  | Plan Type    | <planType>    |
    ##  | Member Type  | <memberType>  |
    ##  | Claim Type   | <claimType>   |
    ##  | Claim System | <claimSystem> |
    ##  | Claim Period | Custom search |
	##Then I can validate the calendar will show up for custom search when click on From and To calendars    
    ##And I should be able to see the error message when no to and from dates being entered
    ##And I custom search claims for the following invalid time interval on claims summary page
    ##  | Claims From Date | 01/02/2019 |
    ##  | Claims To Date   | 01/02/2018 |
    ##Then I should be able to see the from date is greater than the to date error message being displayed
    ##And I custom search claims for over two years time interval from current date on claims summary page
    ##Then I should be able to see the search range is greater than two years error
    #----------------- Test for Custom search --------------------------
    And I can search claims for claim period and claim type on claim summary page
      | Plan Type    | <planType>    |

      | Claim Type   | <claimType>   |
      | Claim System | <claimSystem> |
      | Claim Period | Custom search |
    And I custom search claims for the specific time interval on claims summary page
    Then I can see the number of claims
    Then I perform extensive validation for values between claims summary and claim details page
    #----------------- Test for- Last 30 days --------------------------
    And I can search claims for claim period and claim type on claim summary page
      | Plan Type    | <planType>    |

    Then I can see the number of claims
    #note: covered by E2E also - skip on jenkins run to keep run time within 30 min
    ##And I validate the pagination on the claims summary page for given range
    ##Then I can validate the learn more and print and download option and DownloadMyData section on claims summary page
    Then I can validate claims table displayed based on the selection on claims summary page
    And I can validate the EOB section based on claims system on claims summary page
    And I validate the Need Help section content on claims summary page

    # note: These two steps below only applicable to SHIP and MEDICAL claims, NOTHING will be done for DRUG case
    ##note: covered by E2E also - skip on jenkins run to keep run time within 30 min
    ##Then I validate Claim Details page content value and Learn More and EOB and tooltips
    Then I perform extensive validation for values between claims summary and claim details page

  #----- beginning of claims test for offline prod - local run only ------------------
  # DO NOT REMOVE this scenario
  # This scenario is not part of the regular regression run BUT is for aiding the team to do offline prod testing if needed
  # note: this setup is for the case when we need to validate on offline prod environment
  # note: this is intended for local run where you can put in your own member auth username/password and offline username
  # note: run with environment variable set to offline. -Denvironment="offline"
  # note: *** DO NOT save your login or test username to github ***
  # note: replace the following fields with valid value -
  # note:   username = your memAuth page login username
  # note:   password = your memAuth page login password
  # note:   MemUsername =  username of the user on offline prod that you want to test
  # note:   planType = the type of plan this test user has e.g. MAPD/MA/SHIP, etc
  # note:   memberType = e.g. Individual / GROUP/ COMBO, etc
  # note:   claimSystem = e.g. COSMOS / NICE / RX / COMPASS
  # note:   claimType = e.g. Prescription drug / Medical / NA (for ship)
  # note:   flagZeroClaimsUser = Yes / No (do you want to fail the test if user has 0 claims)
  Scenario Outline: To validate via member authorization access for claims
    Given the user is on member auth login flow page
    When the member is able to login with correct username and password
      | Username | <username> |
      | Password | <password> |
    And Member Enters the Username he wants to search
      | MemUsername | <MemUserName> |
    And user clicks on member to select
    When I navigate to the claims Summary page from dashboard or testharness page
    #When I am validating UI only
    Then I can validate the claims summary header on claims summary page
      | Plan Type   | <planType>   |
      | Member Type | <memberType> |
    Then I can validate the segment ID value in localStorage on claims summary page
      | Segment ID   | <segmentId>   |

    #----------------- Test for Last 24 months --------------------------
    And I can search claims for claim period and claim type on claim summary page
      | Plan Type    | <planType>     |

      | Claim Type   | <claimType>    |
      | Claim System | <claimSystem>  |
      | Claim Period | Last 24 months |
    Then I can see the number of claims
    And I validate the pagination on the claims summary page for given range
    Then I can validate the learn more and print and download option and DownloadMyData section on claims summary page
    Then I can validate claims table displayed based on the selection on claims summary page
    And I can validate the EOB section based on claims system on claims summary page
    And I validate the Need Help section content on claims summary page
    #----------
    # note: These two steps below only applicable to SHIP and MEDICAL claims, NOTHING will be done for DRUG case
    Then I validate Claim Details page content value and Learn More and EOB and tooltips
